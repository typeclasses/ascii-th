{-| An expression pattern corresponding to an ASCII character

=== In an expression context

The result will have a 'ASCII.Superset.FromChar' constraint.

The quasi-quoted string must consist of a single character that is within the
ASCII character set.

@
[char|e|] == SmallLetterE

[char|e|] == (101 :: Word8)
@

Since this is polymorphic, a type signature is recommended.

=== In a pattern context

The pattern matches a value of a type satisfying the 'ASCII.Superset.ToChar'
constraint.

{-| An expression or pattern corresponding to an ASCII string where all the

The letters in the body of the quasi-quotation may be written in any case
you like; they will be converted to lower case automatically.

The expression can become any type belonging to the 'ASCII.Superset.FromString'
class. Any letters in the quoted content will be converted to lower case.

=== In a pattern context

The pattern matches a value of a type satisfying the 'ASCII.Superset.ToString'
constraint. A value matches this pattern if:

* All of the letters in the tested value are in lower case
* The tested value satisfies a case-insensitive comparison
  with the quasi-quoted content
